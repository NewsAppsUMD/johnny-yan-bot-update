#Final Bot Submisssion Memo
I developed a research bot in Python designed to automatically fetch and summarize articles from PubMed. The idea was to assist users—like students or researchers—by reducing the manual effort required to find and review articles on a given medical topic, starting with "Alzheimer's disease." My primary goal was to scrape article titles, abstracts, links, and publication dates and then present them in a digestible summary format. The initial version of the bot used requests and BeautifulSoup to parse the PubMed search results page. I successfully collected metadata such as article titles and links, and followed each article link to retrieve abstracts. Eventually, I was able to extract and format publication dates, filtering the results to only include articles with clearly available dates. I also adjusted the date formatting to be more human-readable (e.g., "April 24, 2021"). To enhance usefulness, I created a second script that generates summaries by breaking abstracts into bullet points using sentence tokenization. However, this is where I hit the roadblock. I couldn't figure out how to get bullet points output in the sumamry without changing my fetch_articles code to add for abstract, while maintaing pyhton dictionaries as the output. If this bot were to accept user input in a more advanced way, it could act as a chatbot or through a website, it could dynamically take user queries (e.g., “Parkinson’s treatment in 2020”) and respond with curated, summarized articles. A more powerful version could even use AI to identify trends across papers or compare findings between studies. I was able however to save the files with the author, title, link, and publication date. Lastly, one more minor issue that I ran into was I wasn't too quite sure why the output was only giving my a few articles (4) instead of doing like the first 10 or the first 2 pages. Not sure how to implement code that allows it to scrape for articles over multiple pages. Finally, I was able to generate code that allowed me to send the messages and output to the Slack channel.
