I added three folders, fetch_articles.py, save_to_csv.py and generate_summary.py. fetch_articles.py retrieves a list of articles from PubMed about Alzheimer's Disease with the title and link to each article. It also gives an abstract from eachj article. save_to_csv.py takes the list of articles and saves them into a CSV file. generate_summary gives the abstract summary of each article with their links. The block that i encountered is that when I input each of these commands, they all print out the same output which is odd.


### March 28 Update
I was able the publication dates for the articles along with the publication authors for each article. I feel like there's more I could do with this but at the moment I'm not sure. One blocker I have is for the generate summary section, I would like it to extract and generate in the output the key points in bullet point format; not quit sure how to do that yet; also the format for the authors in the output seems a bit messy; trying to figure out how to get them organized line by line.
